# Houston Violent Crime Statistics Data Cleaning

- This project was created to demonstrate fundamental data collection, data cleaning and data visualization techniques while obtaining insight into the important social problem of violent crime. Since I am from and currently live in Houston, TX, I chose to look at Houston violent crime data, which is publicly available on the Houston Police Department website: [rb.gy/z6ussk](rb.gy/z6ussk)

- A detailed explanation of the code used to perform each of the data processing steps listed above is provided in the write-up which can be found here: [rb.gy/du7p4r](rb.gy/du7p4r)
