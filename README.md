# Houston Violent Crime Statistics Data Cleaning

- This project was created to demonstrate fundamental data collection, data cleaning and data visualization techniques while obtaining insight into the important social problem of violent crime. Since I am from and currently live in Houston, TX, I chose to look at Houston violent crime data, which is publicly available on the Houston Police Department website: https://www.houstontx.gov/police/cs/crime-stats-archives.htm
